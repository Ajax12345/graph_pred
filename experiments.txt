Experiment 1:
    Nov 26 @ 10:57

    Single P (highest performning result) chosen as parent
        - two training epochs apiece

    Future experiments:
        - remove "update" mutation
        - at the generation of a new population, add k random values from n_p so as to contribute to genetic diversity

    Peak performance of 75%


Experiment 2:
    Nov 26 @ 11:17

    Single P (highest performning result) chosen as parent
        - two training epochs apiece

        - remove "update" mutation

        - at the generation of a new population, add k random values from n_p so as to contribute to genetic diversity


    Future experiments:
        - re-introduce update with a very small probability
        - 

    Best incrementational results so far!



Experiment 3:
    Nov 26 @ 11:51

    Single P (highest performning result) chosen as parent
        - two training epochs apiece

        - remove "update" mutation

        - at the generation of a new population, add k random values from n_p so as to contribute to genetic diversity

        - re-introduce update with a very small probability

    Observations:
        - Updating does not improve accuracy
